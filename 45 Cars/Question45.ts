/*Question 45 Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The 
function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept 
an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, 
such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the 
information was stored correctly.*/
